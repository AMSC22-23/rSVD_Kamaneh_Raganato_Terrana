## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to implement the Random SVD (rSVD) algorithm, which addresses standard matrix decompositions. These decompositions include the pivoted QR factorization, eigenvalue decomposition, and singular value decomposition (SVD).
The project emphasizes the use of randomization as a powerful tool for low-rank matrix approximation. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of utilizing modern computational architectures but also enables effective handling of massive data sets.

## Introduction

The Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (rSVD) is a method for approximating the singular value decomposition of a matrix. This technique is particularly useful for large matrices, where traditional SVD methods may be computationally expensive. Randomized SVD provides an efficient and scalable approach to decomposing a matrix into its singular value, left singular vector, and right singular vector components.

### Mathematical Formulation
Given a matrix $$ A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $$, the randomized SVD aims to approximate the singular value decomposition as follows:

Given a matrix \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \)
