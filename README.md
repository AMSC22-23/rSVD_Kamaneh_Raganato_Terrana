# rSVD_Kamaneh_Raganato_Terrana

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to implement the Random SVD (rSVD) algorithm, which addresses standard matrix decompositions. These decompositions include the pivoted QR factorization, eigenvalue decomposition, and singular value decomposition (SVD).
The project emphasizes the use of randomization as a powerful tool for low-rank matrix approximation. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of utilizing modern computational architectures but also enables effective handling of massive data sets.
